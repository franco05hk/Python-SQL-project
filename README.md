# DVD Store Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with an analysis of a DVD store's dataset. The analysis covers various tasks, including plotting revenue trends, performing sentiment analysis on movie descriptions, visualizing revenue distribution by country, identifying top revenue-generating actors, and classifying countries based on categories.

# Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, PostgreSQL

# Tasks Covered
Time-Series Revenue Plot: A plot showing daily revenue trends for three different countries.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing movie descriptions for sentiment and adding a classification column.
Revenue Distribution: A visual showing revenue distribution from different countries to the DVD store.
Top Actors: Identifying the top 10 revenue-generating actors.
Country Classification: Creating a new DataFrame to classify countries into categories.
Data Merging: Merging the country classification with the DVD store's data.
